When you're in a debate and being asked to (or trying on your own volition) to cite a source for a claim you are making or to refute someone else's claim, it's *extremely* important that we make sure we're posting good information. Unreliable or misleading sources are very common on the internet, and while we don't expect everyone to have collegiate-level research abilities, we *do* have an obligation to ensure that everyone is doing their best to post good information here.\n\nThat's not to say you necessarily did anything wrong! This is just a friendly reminder and some tips to help you out in the future.`,
